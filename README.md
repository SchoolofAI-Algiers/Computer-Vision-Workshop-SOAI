# Computer Vision Workshop
This year, School of AI Algiers has the pleasure to collaborate with WTM Algiers and organize the AI Track during IWD'20. This is the starter repository for all the attendees. The practice part of the workshop will aim to Build a style transfer model using deep CNNs.

Inspired by [Udacity's Introduction to deep learning with pytorch](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch).
## Folder Structure
* intro_CNNs.ipynb: first part of the workshop.
* CIFAR10.ipynb: building a CIFAR10 image classifier using CNNs.
* Style_transfer.ipynb: second part of the workshop where we build the style transfer model.
## Requirements
* Anaconda : Check out their website : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
* PyTorch : `conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch` (https://pytorch.org/)
* Numpy :  `conda install -c anaconda numpy`
* Matplotlib : `conda install matplotlib`
* OpenCV : `conda install -c anaconda opencv`
